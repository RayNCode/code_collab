Final Projet in Machine Learning


14-01-2023

ML_1_Stat_Desc --> Descriptive stats of our variables from learn dataset.
ML_2_Model --> I tried 2 models and compare their performance without using hyperparameters (Random Forest, Logistic Regression). Results are quite similar at this stage.
ML_3_Categories --> I just tried to see what kind of categories we had in the learn dataset to better encode these variables.
ML_Merged_ --> I made several attempts to see how to merge the data and handle missing values.

please don't work on these, they are just here in case we need some code for our Main_ file.

Final Notebook is just the model taken from the 'XGB_final_model' file but applied to test data.

Right now, I'm working on a V2 of this final notebook to do all the steps in one file (getting code from github, pipeline, gridsearch, xgboost, ...). To get better predictions for tonight.

The next stage would be to see how we can incorporate other models, bc now there is only XGBoost.
