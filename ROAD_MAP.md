Final Projet in Machine Learning

ML_1_Stat_Desc --> Descriptive stats of our variables from learn dataset.
ML_2_Model --> I tried 2 models and compare their performance without using hyperparameters (Random Forest, Logistic Regression). Results are quite similar at this stage.
ML_2_Categories --> I just tried to see what kind of categories we had in the learn dataset to better encode these variables.

Next steps:

Priority:
- Maybe explore other binary classifiers (as explained in the ML_2_Model towards the end).
- Try to use hyperparameters and GradientDescent to better tune our models.
- Create another notebook with strategies to merge and manage missing values of other csv files.
  We can start merging one dataset at the time.

  Next Level:
- After this, the goal would be to write a code that is as efficient as possible (meaning creating functions to declutter the code). And then start creating the best pipeline possible before feeding our model.
- Since the code is quite repetitive between models, we should be able to automate that. It also means that we have to be cautious with the code because it will take longer to run.
