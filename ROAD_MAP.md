Final Projet in Machine Learning


15-01-2023

Things to work on:

- Replicate XGB_final_model.ipynb by using Logistic Regression, Random Forest (so we have three models to compare), if time NN but this is really optiional and not mandotary at our stage.
  I am also curois whether setting B=1 and G=0 has an impact. Since we have class imbalance (61% vs 39%), what if we set B=1 and G=-1 ? I am not sure if it impacts the results.
- Looking at ColumTransformer.ipynb to see how we can make it work. Otherwise, we'll have to keep what I did in XGB_Predictions.ipynb
- Once we have all the models with their best hyperparameters, let's compare their performance. We can use the same code used for XGB to plot the results. We can also use _plot_ROC_LearningCurve.ipynb, there are some bits of code.
- Once we have done all this, we write our report using Quarto.
